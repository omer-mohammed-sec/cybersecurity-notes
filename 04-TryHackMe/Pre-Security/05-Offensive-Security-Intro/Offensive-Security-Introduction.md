\# Offensive Security Basics



Offensive Security focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications in a controlled and legal manner.



The main goal is to think like an attacker in order to improve an organisation’s security posture.



Key topics learned:

\- Ethical hacking concepts

\- Penetration testing methodology

\- Reconnaissance and enumeration

\- Exploiting misconfigurations and weak controls



I learned the difference between:

\- Ethical hackers and malicious attackers

\- Vulnerability scanning and exploitation

\- Automated tools and manual testing



Tools introduced during this stage:

\- Nmap for network scanning

\- Gobuster for directory enumeration

\- SQLmap for detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities



Offensive security helps organisations identify weaknesses before real attackers exploit them.
