\# Web Fundamentals



Web applications are one of the most common targets for cyber attacks.



In this module, I learned:

\- How websites and web applications function

\- The role of browsers and web servers

\- HTTP request and response flow

\- URLs, parameters, and cookies



I was introduced to common web-related security issues, such as:

\- Misconfigured web servers

\- Exposed admin pages

\- Input validation issues



This knowledge is critical for both offensive security testing and defensive monitoring.
