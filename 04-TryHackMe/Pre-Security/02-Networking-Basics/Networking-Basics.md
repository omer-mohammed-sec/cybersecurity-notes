\# Networking Fundamentals



Networking knowledge is essential for cybersecurity professionals because most attacks occur over networks.



Topics covered in this module:

\- What networks are and how they work

\- Difference between LAN, WAN, and the Internet

\- IP addresses and ports

\- Common network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS)

\- Client-server architecture



I learned how attackers abuse network services and how defenders monitor network traffic to detect attacks.



Understanding networking fundamentals allows me to:

\- Analyse traffic

\- Identify suspicious connections

\- Understand how attacks spread
