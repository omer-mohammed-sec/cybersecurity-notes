\# Linux Fundamentals



Linux is widely used in cybersecurity environments, including servers, security tools, and penetration testing platforms.



In this module, I learned:

\- Linux directory structure

\- Basic file and directory operations

\- User accounts and permissions

\- Using the terminal and command-line tools



I practiced using Kali Linux, which is commonly used for security testing and analysis.



Linux skills are essential for working with security tools and understanding system-level behavior.
