\# Defensive Security Basics



Defensive Security focuses on preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber attacks.



In this module, I learned how organisations protect their assets and monitor activity to detect suspicious behavior.



Key defensive concepts:

\- Monitoring and logging

\- Incident detection and alerting

\- Incident response lifecycle

\- Defence in depth strategy



I learned that defensive security teams work continuously to:

\- Identify abnormal behavior

\- Respond quickly to incidents

\- Minimise damage and downtime

\- Improve security controls after incidents



Defensive security is essential for maintaining trust, compliance, and operational stability.
