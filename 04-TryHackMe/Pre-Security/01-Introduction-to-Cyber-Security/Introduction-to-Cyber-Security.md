\# Introduction to Cyber Security



Cybersecurity is the discipline of protecting digital systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage.



In this module, I learned the core purpose of cybersecurity and why it is critical in modern organisations.



Key concepts covered:

\- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)

\- Types of cyber threats (malware, phishing, insider threats)

\- Difference between threats, vulnerabilities, and risks

\- Importance of cybersecurity for businesses, governments, and individuals



I also learned that cybersecurity is not only about technology, but also involves people and processes.



This module helped me understand the big picture of cybersecurity before diving into technical topics.
