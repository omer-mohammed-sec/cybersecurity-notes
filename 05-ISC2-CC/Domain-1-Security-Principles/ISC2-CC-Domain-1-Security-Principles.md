Security Principles (ISC² CC)

1\. Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)

Confidentiality



Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals.

Achieved through access controls, encryption, and authentication mechanisms.



Integrity



Ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered.

Implemented using hashing, checksums, and digital signatures.



Availability



Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed.

Maintained through redundancy, backups, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery.



2\. Least Privilege



Users and systems should have only the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.

This reduces the risk of misuse, errors, or compromise.



3\. Defense in Depth



A layered security approach where multiple controls protect systems and data.

If one control fails, others continue to provide protection.



Examples:



Firewalls



IDS/IPS



Endpoint protection



Security policies



4\. Risk Management

Risk



The potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.



Risk Components



Threat



Vulnerability



Impact



Risk Treatment Options



Risk Acceptance



Risk Avoidance



Risk Mitigation



Risk Transfer



5\. Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Exploits

Threat



Any potential cause of an unwanted incident.



Vulnerability



A weakness that can be exploited.



Exploit



The method or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability.



6\. Security Controls

Administrative Controls



Policies, procedures, training, and awareness programs.



Technical Controls



Firewalls, encryption, antivirus, SIEM, IDS/IPS.



Physical Controls



Locks, cameras, access badges, security guards.



7\. Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)

Authentication



Verifying the identity of a user.



Authorization



Determining what actions a user is allowed to perform.



Accounting



Tracking user activities through logs and monitoring.



8\. Security Policies



Formal rules that define how systems and data should be protected.



Examples:



Password policy



Acceptable use policy



Incident response policy



9\. Incident Response Basics



Key phases:



Preparation



Detection



Containment



Eradication



Recovery



Lessons Learned



10\. Importance of Security Awareness



Human error is one of the biggest security risks.

Training users helps prevent phishing, social engineering, and weak password practices.
